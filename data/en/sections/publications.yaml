  paper:
    summary: Automated Skin Disease Classification using Transfer Learning Developed a deep learning framework to classify six types of skin diseases (including Melanoma and Eczema) to assist in early clinical diagnosis. By comparing several architectures, NASNetLarge was identified as the top performer with 90% accuracy, significantly reducing diagnostic complexity through automated image processing.

  paper:
    summary: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis of Bengali Sports Comments Developed a deep learning framework to analyze fan emotions across Football, Cricket, Hockey, and Badminton using a dataset of 3,759 Bengali social media comments. By utilizing GloVe word embeddings and a Hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture, the model categorizes sentiments into five classes; Positive, Negative, Neutral, Happy, and Sad. The hybrid approach outperformed standalone models, achieving a peak accuracy of 97.45%.
